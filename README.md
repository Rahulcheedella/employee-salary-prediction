📊 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning
🚀 Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning-based web application that predicts whether an employee's annual salary is greater than 50K or less than/equal to 50K, based on features like age, workclass, education, occupation, marital status, hours worked per week, etc.

The project demonstrates the complete end-to-end ML workflow:

Data preprocessing

Feature encoding & scaling

Model training & evaluation

Saving trained model

Building a Flask web application for deployment

Users can interact with a web interface where they input employee details, and the application will predict the salary category (>50K or <=50K).
